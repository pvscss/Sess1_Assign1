1. Say True or False for the below statements:
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes? Yes
• Base R packages installed automatically? Yes


2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?

When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same length, R automatically recycles, or repeats, the shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one.

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
> c(1,2,3,4,5) + c(1,3)
[1] 2 5 4 7 6
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) + c(1, 3) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

As you can see, the c(1,3) vector repeated itself to form c(1,3,1,3,1,3) so that it could successfully match the previous term.

If the shorter vector is not a vector of the longer one, then a warning message appears, but the operation still takes place.
